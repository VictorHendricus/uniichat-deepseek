// Billing
// =======
// All a server does for money, behind one boundary: Billing.open gives
// the server's billing, which the accounts hold (Cloud.ts), and no other
// file knows what it is. It says whether the server bills (`bills`:
// /api/hello, /api/me, /api/account and each chat's state carry it, and
// no client shows a price, a balance or a payment where it is false),
// whose the accounts are, what a chat may spend, and the payer each of
// its paid requests asks right before it is sent (AskAI.ts Bill).
//
// This one is FREE: the server runs on its own API keys. An account is
// an email here (Cloud.ts users), no request waits for a payer, nothing
// is owed, and no route but the accounts' answers. A hosted server plugs
// in a billing of its own with the same shape.
